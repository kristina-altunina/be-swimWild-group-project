# to do

- write scraping function for sea temperatures
- use ML to improve inland data processing?
- build function for checking whether you are near an AAB warning - cannot search areas atm so make a manual exclusion zone. 20km? 10km? Maybe a warning if its close and give details?
- build master function that takes a lat and long and a type (river, lake, sea) and returns all api data
- this data could be cached in mongoDB for a period of time?
- get data for surf and tide
- get pollution and green algae warnings via scraping?
