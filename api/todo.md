# to do

- find AAB for wales and scotland. https://www.gov.uk/quality-of-local-bathing-water
- add units to inland api
- live weather API, wind speed, humidity, temp, precipitation. If possible, get last 7 days.
- build function for checking whether you are near an AAB warning - cannot search areas atm so make a manual exclusion zone. 20km? 10km? Maybe a warning if its close and give details?
- if no regression data, send something else useful for inland hydrology spots

- use ML to improve inland data processing?
- build master function that takes a lat and long and a type (river, lake, sea) and returns all api data
- this data could be cached in mongoDB for a period of time?
- get tide data
- get pollution and green algae warnings via scraping?

Forcast for the week:

Weather
hydrology data over 7 days
